sdesc: "Tunnel TCP connections through HTTP proxies"
ldesc: "A simple tool to tunnel TCP connections through an HTTP proxy
supporting the CONNECT method. It reads stdin and writes to stdout
during the connection, just like netcat. It can be used for instance
to connect to an SSH server running on a remote 443 port through a
strict HTTPS proxy."
